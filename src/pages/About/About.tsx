                                I am a student closing in on my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. I currently have been gaining experience in full-stack Web Development but have expanded my knowledge to include working in other areas such as embedded systems and working with simulation software. Currently, I am working on a project with the Florida Space Institute to create a teleoperation console for their RERASSOR rover program.

                                Growing up I had limited access to the internet, so I spent most of my time exploring the world around me and picking up different skills that interested me. At some point I came across a computer and stumbled upon a tutorial on learning C. I made a simple program that calculated how fast a ball would fall on Earth using the formula for acceleration I was taught in school. The power a computer held instantly became clear to me, and I wanted to learn everything and more.

                                At some point I wanted to know how it all came together and learn how we got from rocks and lightning to YouTube. I delved deeper and came across videos of people building computers using Redstone in the game Minecraft. I followed along with tutorials and built my own computer in the game, and was eventually recommended <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&si=343dXdZQaIbT36HL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this amazing video series</a> by Ben Eater. Months of obsession later I eventually bought an Arduino and started programming and building my own circuits.

                                Soon, programming became a part of everything I didâ€”I programmed custom LED lights, set up my own HomeLab server, and even used a language called kOS to control rockets in my favorite game, Kerbal Space Program. I quickly realized the incredible potential of computer science and how much more there was to explore. That's when I decided to pursue a degree in the field.

                                In the future, I plan to further my education, ideally coming back to school for a Master's degree. In the meantime, I'm focused on completing my studies and working on various exciting projects, and actively seeking opportunities in the industry.

                                Although I'm finishing up school, I consider myself to be a lifelong student. I'm always looking for new things to learn and new ways to grow. As I look ahead, I'm excited yet a bit nervous to discover what lies on the path ahead.
